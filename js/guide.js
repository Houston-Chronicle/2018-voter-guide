Where if you go to school and work hard, you can expect to support a family, raise and educate your children, enjoy a healthy and fulfilling life and retire with dignity. \n\nUnfortunately, instead of making that promise a reality, our current Governor puts up barriers to progress while peddling a pay-to-play brand of politics. It’s high time we have someone fighting for everyday working Texans rather than their rich donors and special interests lobbyists. Texans deserve better than that and I am running to serve them. From investing in our public schools, to ensuring access to high quality health care, to creating an economy that works for everyone – Texans deserve a Governor who is fighting to expand opportunity for all Texans, not just the lucky few.\n\nThis campaign is about giving a voice to the everyday working Texan that has been left behind, no matter their political views. It shouldn’t matter who you are, where you are from, what color your skin is or who you love - you deserve to have the same opportunities to succeed as anyone else and I’m fighting to make that a reality in Texas.","difference":"Texans are excited to vote for someone who will govern for all Texans, not just some of them; bring us together, not divide us; and someone who understands their uphill battles and the kitchen table issues that keep them up at night because they’ve been through them themselves. Our current Governor’s track record shows that he’s an out-of-touch career politician of a quarter of a decade who caters to rich donors, special interest lobbyists, and is a poster boy for the hate and fear-based Trump agenda, especially that against Latinos and immigrants. Unlike my opponent, I’m fighting for a Texas that is fairer, more tolerant and where everyday Texans having a fighting chance.","priority1":"Education: My whole agenda is equal opportunity for everyone, which applies to my three top issue areas: health care, education and the economy. They are all interconnected in the goal of working to ensure that the everyday Texan has a fighting chance to realize the American Dream. Despite my humble upbringing in the poorest neighborhood in San Antonio, a Texas public school gave me the opportunity to succeed. Our public schools are the path to opportunity, but for too many Texans, that opportunity is slipping away under the current Governor’s failed policies. A child's background, zip code, race, or how much money their parents make shouldn’t matter - every child deserves the chance to succeed. It is the state’s responsibility to ensure all of our children have the opportunity to receive a quality education; and right now, the state simply isn’t doing its job. Governor Greg Abbott has consistently decreased the share of funding it contributes (48.5% for 2008 to 38% for 2019) and has put the load on local school districts and homeowners to pick up the slack - driving up our property taxes. On top of this, he has failed to remove the cap on special education funding, leading Texas to be in violation of federal law that requires all students who qualify receive special education services. That is why fixing our education system is one of my top priorities. If we want to prepare Texas for the future and ensure our kids are ready to compete in a global economy, we need to prioritize investing in education. First, we must fix our broken school finance system. It is past time for the state to pay their fair share and stop placing the burden on local communities and homeowners. On financing, it is critical to update our outdated funding models and ensure that funding is equitable across Texas. We also must begin to pay and treat our teachers like the professionals that they are and make sure they are teaching to our children and not a standardized test. If we want to build an education system that is the envy of the nation, we must recruit and retain the most talented teachers and truly invest in this critical workforce. In addition, we must honor those who have dedicated their careers to teaching our children by properly funding retired teacher pensions at a rate that keeps pace with the cost of living. Finally, we know that the opportunity gap has already started by the time students get to kindergarten, when so many children fall behind and miss out on the overwhelming benefits of early childhood education. That is why I will fight for universal Pre-K for all Texas students. It is time to get serious about investing in our children and investing in our future.","priority2":"Health Care: When I was a young child, my sister was in a car accident that left her with such severe brain injuries that she became mentally and physically involent. We couldn’t afford proper medical care, so we took care of her at home. This took such a toll on my family -- both economically and emotionally --that a few relatives had to be sent to the hospital from stress and exhaustion Too many Texans go through similar hardships, because they don’t have access to quality and affordable health care. That is simply unacceptable. Health care is a right and it is time we treat it as such. We are experiencing a health care crisis in Texas. An unregulated private health care system puts profit over people and neglects the care of the most vulnerable among us, while we remain the most uninsured state in the country with 1 in 6 Texans lacking coverage. Instead of addressing this crisis, our Governor foolishly rejects Medicaid expansion, leaving 9 billion federal dollars on the table and nearly 1.5 million Texans without access to healthcare coverage. The truth is, we’re already paying for universal healthcare - it’s called the emergency room - the most expensive and inefficient way possible. As Governor, I would immediately push the state to accept Medicaid expansion and take advantage of this opportunity to insure more people and improve health outcomes. The evidence is clear that states that have accepted Medicaid expansion have seen better results. improved health outcomes. Why would Texas not take advantage of that opportunity? Additionally, we must invest more in expanding access to critical healthcare in our rural communities, which have become medical deserts after Texas has closed down more rural hospitals than any other state in the country in the last eight years. Lastly, I will fight tirelessly to protect women’s health and fundamental rights to their own bodies, so that women to have every resource necessary to make decisions about their own health -- including safe and easy access to clinics and contraceptives. These shouldn't be polarizing issues -- this should be about treating people with dignity and respect, improving health outcomes, and strengthening the health of Texas.","priority3":"Economy: I believe an honest day’s work deserves an honest day’s pay. Texans are working harder each day, but the gap continues to expand. We can and we must break open the doors of opportunity for everyone. We must support policies that improve education and provide a solid foundation for Texans to get ahead. The jobs of the future and the Texas we pass on to the next generation all come back to how we prepare our people to address the challenges ahead. This means expanding access to everything from early childhood education, to college readiness programs, to vocational training aimed at producing a skilled workforce. And it isn't only about building a knowledge base -- it's about an economy that provides economic security, opportunity and inclusivity. Governor Greg Abbott likes to talk about all these jobs coming to Texas, but the reality is that folks are having to work two or three of them to make ends meet. It’s not about the quantity, but the quality of jobs. Anyone working 40 hours a week should be able to earn a living wage and provide for their family. We must fight to pass paid sick leave across Texas, not shut down efforts on the local level. No one should have to choose between a job or caring for a sick loved one. Additionally, an economy that doesn’t treat women equally is simply not thriving. We must truly break down the barriers and level the playing field for women in the economy by make sure there is equal pay for equal work. Lastly, while politicians in Austin debate cruel and divisive legislation like the show-me-your-papers and bathroom bills, the Texas economic brand is suffering. This nonsense has got to stop. Workers, small businesses, innovators, and entrepreneurs all agree that it's time to embrace, not suppress, the fact that we are the most diverse state in the country. That diversity is part of what makes us great, and it presents us with even greater opportunity in a competitive global economy. To build a thriving and prosperous Texas that appeals to business -- big and small -- we must start by investing in the workforce itself. Texans should be able to truly get ahead and climb the ladder to the middle class and beyond - no matter who they are, where they are from or who they love.","contact":"Website: www.lupevaldez.com; Facebook: www.facebook.com/LupeforTexas; Twitter: @LupeValdez","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Governor","name":"Mark Jay Tippetts","party":"(L)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/14/16245543/3/rawImage.jpg","age":52,"hometown":"Austin, Texas","birthplace":"Chihuahua, Mexico","job":"International Business & Legal Consultant","education":"Master's Degree","education2":"","college":"Universidad Abierta de San Luis Potosi-2010 \nUniversidad Abierta de San Luis Potosi-2012","married":"Married","kids":6,"prevServed":"Yes","prevOffice":"City Council, Lago Vista, Texas","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#ECC850","reason":"To oppose further erosion of our liberties, and roll back such existing infringements to ensure that my children and grandchildren grow up free.","difference":"Unlike the old party candidates, I have a solution mindset, focused on free market approaches.

Through my work with organizations that fight sex trafficking I have first hand knowledge of how we can shut down sex traffickers and provide a real path of rehabilitation to the victims. I'm an everyday Texan that understands the struggles to make ends meet. After my divorce, I worked three jobs to try and keep my head above the water and still was an active volunteer in my community.","priority1":"My top priority is to address public education finance reform which includes lowering our property taxes. Our public schools are not properly funded because the state legislature keeps lessening the amount that state pays and requiring that homeowners take on more than their fair share. Our Texas constitution states in Article 7 that the state will provide for the maintenance and support of an efficient system for public schools. Our schools are not able to make the grade of efficiency because the legislature keeps siphoning away funding. In the early 2000s the state provided closer to 50% of the funding for public education. Whereas the last legislative session, the legislature voted that the state would only provide 38% of state funding towards public education. This transfer of responsibility was handed over to the homeowners. When the legislature voted to increase property taxes by 14% in order to balance their budget. We need to properly fund our schools, lower our property taxes, and pay our teachers wages that ensure they aren't struggling to survive.","priority2":"My second top priority is addressing flood control in TXHD132 and our state as a whole. We need to build the third reservoir and not just talk about it. Numerous studies have been done, we've known for over thirty years it needed to happen, we cannot suffer another Harvey and that will happen again if we do not focus on mitigation now and not repairs later. We also need to create a task force that inspects all Texas counties plans of action for before and after the storm. We learned a lot during Harvey and the big thing was we weren't prepared for it before or after. Hurricane Harvey was my first ever natural disaster, I had no idea that if I wanted to evacuate I only had a certain amount of time to do so and then it was too late. This was not communicated to us. Instead I found myself in chest high water, trying to alert my neighbors to seek their roofs if need be for rescue. The aftermath of Harvey was a prime example of disaster in regards to loss of water, power, and the filth that was flooding around us. We need a task force to inspect each counties plan of action for before and after catastrophic weather events and make sure we keep our citizens prepared, informed, and safe.","priority3":"My third top priority is to address sex trafficking in our state. Houston/Katy community is one of the largest sex trafficking areas in the world. The only way we as a community can shut down this horrible epidemic is through prevention, prosecution for the traffickers, and providing a real path of rehabilitation to the victims. Our current system does not provide a path that will prevent the cycle of abuse for these victims. Not only is this immoral to ignore this travesty but also creates a 6.5 million dollar drain on social services for our state by not addressing this huge problem which will not go away on it's own. I'm committed to making sure it does.","contact":"Email: ginafortexas@gmail.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":"Yes"},{"office":"Texas House, District 132","name":"Daniel Arevalo","party":"(L)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/45/16247161/3/rawImage.jpg","age":"","hometown":"","birthplace":"","job":"","education":"","education2":"","college":"","married":"","kids":"","prevServed":"","prevOffice":"","military":"","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#ECC850","reason":"","difference":"","priority1":"","priority2":"","priority3":"","contact":"","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas House, District 132","name":"Mike Schofield","party":"(R)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/40/16246836/3/rawImage.jpg","age":"","hometown":"","birthplace":"","job":"","education":"","education2":"","college":"","married":"","kids":"","prevServed":"","prevOffice":"","military":"","milBranch":"","incumbent":"Incumbent","partyColor":"#E91D0E","reason":"","difference":"","priority1":"","priority2":"","priority3":"","contact":"","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas House, District 133","name":"Marty Schexnayder","party":"(D)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/45/16247161/3/rawImage.jpg","age":51,"hometown":"Houston, Texas","birthplace":"Houston, Texas","job":"Attorney","education":"Juris Doctorate","education2":"","college":"University of Texas- 1988\nUniversity of Texas Law School- 1991","married":"Married","kids":2,"prevServed":"No","prevOffice":"","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#34AAE0","reason":"To improve lives of Texans and residents of TX Dist 133","difference":"I am not motivated by corporate interests or personal enrichment; I want to advance laws that improve the lives of Texans and residents of TX Dist 133","priority1":"Improve/Increase Funding for Public Ed","priority2":"Enhance Flood Control in District 133","priority3":"Reduce Property Taxes","contact":"Email: marty@schexnayder2018.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":"Yes"},{"office":"Texas House, District 133","name":"Jim Murphy","party":"(R)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/40/16246838/3/rawImage.jpg","age":"","hometown":"","birthplace":"","job":"","education":"","education2":"","college":"","married":"","kids":"","prevServed":"","prevOffice":"","military":"","milBranch":"","incumbent":"Incumbent","partyColor":"#E91D0E","reason":"","difference":"","priority1":"","priority2":"","priority3":"","contact":"","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas House, District 134","name":"Allison Lami Sawyer","party":"(D)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/15/40/16308255/4/rawImage.jpg","age":33,"hometown":"Huntsville, Alabama","birthplace":"Huntsville, Alabama","job":"Business Owner","education":"Master's Degree","education2":"","college":"University of Colorado-(Grad year not listed); \nRice University-(Grad year not listed); \nLeeds University in England-(Grad year not listed)","married":"Married","kids":1,"prevServed":"No","prevOffice":"","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#34AAE0","reason":"I am unhappy with our state government for failing to make evidence based decisions to resolve the issues with our schools, foster care, healthcare, infrastructure, and more.","difference":"My opponent has voted to reduce state funding for public schools.

The goal for every child should be to attend and finish a four-year college or complete skills training. To make that a reality, we must make a quality education affordable. That is why I voted against tuition deregulation in 2003 and have supported legislation to reinstate tuition regulation. I also helped pass and have worked to protect the top 10% rule in Texas. Next session I will also be introducing legislation to improve our school accountability system.","contact":"Houston Office Open 9-5, Monday-Friday 5445 Almeda, Suite #501 Houston, TX 77003 Phone: 713-520-5355 Fax: 713-520-1860; District Director email: Angelita.Gomez@house.texas.gov Capitol (Austin) Office Open 9-5, Monday-Friday Texas Capitol, Room 4N.10 1100 N.

It’s been twelve years since District 15 has seen a two-party choice and voters here deserve to see that both sides are seeking to represent the community. My family and I relocated to Texas a few years ago and during the first election cycle after the move, I was shocked to see only Republicans on the ballot. At the same time, I was extremely concerned that Texas has not been funding public schools adequately, and, despite having many critical issues statewide to address, the Texas legislature called a special session on bathrooms. No session about our school funding and safety, about Harvey recovery, or about our growing uncompensated healthcare crisis. It was clear to me that we need to stop the finger pointing, and elect responsible, problem-solving adults to represent us in Austin. So, I decided to run.","difference":"The biggest difference is that I show-up while my opponent is absent to the point he does not even list his positions on issues on his website. I believe representation requires engaging all across our community, and I advocate that the bedrock of our democracy is an informed electorate. I engage with voters from both ends of the political spectrum-- from people I meet at school football games, to residents in apartments and low-income housing to prominent business leaders, to ALL faith communities. Everywhere I go I ask which issues are most important to them, and I listen to their answers. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we don't-- but as a representative it is important to listen to ALL voices. I believe my educational and professional background also gives me unique qualifications. As a lawyer with expertise in resolving complicated disputes between companies, governments and individuals, I understand the value of starting with small agreements and building upon those to untangle larger issues. In Austin, I will make time for all constituents, hear both sides of every issue and then I will make bipartisanship my number one rule. I intend to only file bills that have a Republican co-sponsor so that we may build consensus and start to breakdown the gridlock that is consuming our Texas legislature. I want to work together with my colleagues and stop the political games-- I will build bridges, not walls.","priority1":"My top priority is to restore funding for public education to its fullest without raising property taxes. The state of Texas has reduced it's investment in our public schools for more than a decade. Because this is not sustainable for our ISDs, they are forced into raising local taxes and shifting the burden of paying for public schools solely onto homeowners and small businesses. So legislators who want to slash & burn our public services use the opportunity they created to point at our public schools and say 'they're raising your taxes.' In effect, what's really happening is that homeowners are getting hit with two higher taxes (increased school tax and increased property tax). Additionally, Texas now ranks 36th nationwide in per-pupil spending -- $2,555 less per student than the national average! And still conservative Republicans like my opponent respond to this with proposals for vouchers that would allow public tax dollars to be funneled past our public schools and into private schools-- or by cutting state contributions to special education, which will further weaken our public schools. This cannot continue-- our public education system is the foundation of our state and country's future. One equitable approach to resolving the issue is to control property taxes on homeowners and small businesses. We can adequately fund education at the state level by closing the corporate tax loophole that allows large corporations to under-pay on property taxes. Then, we MUST take care of our teachers to attract and retain their talent-- and we need to honor their commitment by ensuring their financial security in retirement and the promise we made to them is fulfilled. Teachers dedicate their lives to the service of our communities and our children, and I am dedicated to protecting the investments they've worked for during their careers.","priority2":"I believe health care is a basic human right rather than a privilege, and I believe that pre-existing conditions should not limit the healthcare a person can afford. I've spent a considerable amount of time listening to the leaders of our local hospital systems-- they are our District's largest employers and have a front-row seat to understand where changes can be enacted. When 4.3 million Texans, including more than 600,000 children, are too often using the Emergency Room as their only source of care, we all agree that care is more expensive for all of us and that the need for change has reached a breaking point. Uninsured patient costs are cited as the biggest issue facing healthcare in Texas today-- also referred to as \"uncompensated care\". To address our uncompensated care crisis, I will fight to expand Medicaid to protect our most vulnerable neighbors – children, the disabled, and the elderly. By using incentives to encourage insurers to participate in health care exchanges, especially in areas with limited access to health care options, we can improve health outcomes. This will also benefit our healthcare systems who are getting hit hard by uninsured patient costs. These actions will also help to decrease health care costs for all Texans. The bottom line is that Texans are more likely to be productive members of society when they have access to affordable healthcare and do not have to decide between putting food on the table or paying for the care they need. The path to fixing these issues will require significant debate and negotiation, and I am committed to getting the deal done.","priority3":"The Houston metro area will face future storms and floods-- Harvey was a wake-up call. Now is the time to enact meaningful flood mitigation initiatives and invest in infrastructure development. U.S. News & World Reports ranks our state 21st for infrastructure-- our infrastructure is aging and has not kept up with growth. In regards to flooding specifically, for decades our legislature has not seen through important projects that could help protect Texans from billions of dollars of fixes after storms-- patches don't solve problems, they delay results and in the end they cost us more. Let’s stop the cycle of flood and fix. At the local level, we must work together to find regional solutions that cross county lines and address whole watersheds. Watersheds are wild and don't always fall into a single jurisdiction-- so we also need to build processes, practices and relationships so our local entities are better at working together for preventative projects and response to natural disasters. The Harris County Bond Referendum alone will not be enough to cover flood recovery and mitigation projects. I want to work with groups of experts like the Army Corps of Engineers and scientists at the SPEED Institute at Rice University among others to understand where projects can have the most impact, and I want to align with grassroots groups who are organizing and providing critical on-the-ground reports about where and how flooding occurred. Ultimately as we procure funding through state and federal sources, we will need to order project implementation so that we're making the most efficient use of our financial resources. Solving our flood issues is a massive undertaking that is not going to be fixed overnight, but if we as a state are disciplined about how we work together and move through our projects, we can make lasting improvements.","contact":"Email: info@lorenafortexas.com; Phone: 281-944-5503","unopposed":"","endorsed":"Yes"},{"office":"Texas House, District 15","name":"Steve Toth","party":"(R)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/40/16246839/3/rawImage.jpg","age":"","hometown":"","birthplace":"","job":"","education":"","education2":"","college":"","married":"","kids":"","prevServed":"","prevOffice":"","military":"","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#E91D0E","reason":"","difference":"","priority1":"","priority2":"","priority3":"","contact":"","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas House, District 150","name":"Michael Shawn Kelly","party":"(D)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/07/20/16282664/4/rawImage.jpg","age":62,"hometown":"Spring, Texas","birthplace":"Washington D.C.","job":"Landscape Architect","education":"Bachelor's Degree","education2":"","college":"Texas A&M, 1977, 1979","married":"Married","kids":4,"prevServed":"No","prevOffice":"","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#34AAE0","reason":"Spring/Klein/Tomball needs a state representative that is looking out for the people that live in these communities.

Together with the other state representatives, your representative works to find practical solutions that will support your district and complement all. Representatives should know their districts well - know what keeps constituents awake at night, what services are needed and how to help residents thrive. While in Austin, representatives are the voices of their districts; at home, they are the eyes and ears, always looking for ways to help the district succeed. An undesirable representative is one who is absent and out of touch, meets the needs of only a small private sector and is generally unknown to the public. \nA state rep should have a strong background in community involvement and advocacy prior to becoming a state representative. This service need not have been on a political level but one should be able to look at their history and see that this is a person that cares for the well-being of others and have made positive contributions and is unselfish.

Her absence in the district and failure to recognize the needs of Senate District 17 has been acutely felt, especially in light of the devastation our district experienced by Hurricane Harvey.","priority1":"Solving our public school funding crisis. Only 38% of public education funding comes from the State. We must return the state’s share to 50%. The continued reduction in the state’s share of education funding has caused two problems. First it has impacted our ability to graduate an educated work force. Second it has forced local school districts to increase property taxes to make up the decreased state share. Increased state funding for education is the fastest way to address our ever-increasing property taxes. My opponent has consistently voted for budgets that cut the state’s share for education. That has hurt our ability to educate and it has raised your property taxes.","priority2":"Expanding access to quality, affordable health care while bringing down insurance premiums. One of my top priorities is reversing the deep cuts to health and human services that occurred in past Legislative sessions, and expanding the availability of health care via opting into Medicaid expansion under the ACA. Refusing billions of federal dollars (tax dollars that you paid) that would have insured Texans is fiscally irresponsible. I will work to reverse that policy. It makes no sense that tax dollars paid by Texans are not being used in Texas.","priority3":"Promoting smart infrastructure projects to manage the threat of flooding and demanding the state does its part when disaster strikes. To start, we must address Houston’s rapid expansion and unchecked development that is causing land that once soaked up rainwater to disappear, and worsening the danger posed by flooding. We cannot continue our past rate of urban expansion without building new reservoirs and retention projects and investing in innovative infrastructure to improve water flow and prevent future flooding. As we have seen firsthand, these problems are real and they must be addressed in the 2019 session. However, we’ve also seen the lack of response by the State. Providing residents with immediate and urgent support requires cooperation with the Governor and the Texas Legislature. At best, that response is too slow and at worst non-existent, so another priority of mine will be to innovate State urgent support programs to adequately respond after a disaster like Hurricane Harvey.","contact":"Email: info@ritalucido.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas Senate, District 17","name":"Lauren LaCount","party":"(L)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/46/16247172/3/rawImage.jpg","age":"","hometown":"","birthplace":"","job":"","education":"","education2":"","college":"","married":"","kids":"","prevServed":"","prevOffice":"","military":"","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#ECC850","reason":"","difference":"","priority1":"","priority2":"","priority3":"","contact":"","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"Texas Senate, District 17","name":"Joan Huffman","party":"(R)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/76/40/16246791/3/rawImage.jpg","age":62,"hometown":"Houston, Texas","birthplace":"New Iberia, Louisiana","job":"State Senator/Attorney","education":"Doctorate Degree","education2":"Juris Doctorate","college":"Louisiana State University- 1979\nSouth Texas College of Law- 1984","married":"Married","kids":1,"prevServed":"Yes","prevOffice":"Judge of the 183rd Criminal District Court, 1999-2005; Incumbent","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"Incumbent","partyColor":"#E91D0E","reason":"I want to keep Texas as the best state to live, work, and raise a family.","difference":"As a former criminal court judge and the current senator for Senate District 17, I have the experience and knowledge required to be an effective legislator for my constituents.

I'll also work in Congress to protect the millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions who currently receive affordable health insurance. We can't go back to the days when people with a pre-existing condition were denied insurance or critical care.","priority2":"Flooding: Flooding has had a severe impact on our people and property in TX-02 and across the region.

Economy/Jobs: In Congress, I would make investing in our people a top priority by working to build a pipeline of lifelong learning. If Americans have access to the right education and training, we can compete and win against anyone. Period.

Expanded national service can help make this affordable and also help young people pay for college, too.

When a judge is told he can't do his job because he's Mexican-American, or when the administration refuses to condemn a Nazi rally in Charlottesville, we have to take a stand and speak out for true American values. I'm running for Congress because I believe our country is one that treats those who are less fortunate with compassion, that is reasonable in the way we deal with each other, and treats all people with decency and respect.","difference":"The main difference between my opponent and me is one of temperament and representation. Unlike my opponent, I attended a town hall hosted by residents who were affected by Hurricane Harvey; I attended town halls hosted by high schoolers in the wake of Santa Fe to listen to their concerns and issues; and I showed up to forums and meet and greets throughout the district, because that's what a representative should do. My opponent does not show up. He couldn't show up to the funeral of a student who died in a local school shooting, he was 'too busy' to agree to debates (we offered him 12 different dates and times), and he has consistently been missing from forums and town halls throughout this District.\n\nEven if a constituent disagrees with me on a policy or issue, I promise to be present. I promise always to listen and to be held accountable, because that is the most basic responsibility a member of Congress should have. That's why Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike are supporting my campaign.\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, a Republican colleague and I founded a bipartisan initiative called 'Breaking Bread,' aimed at reducing partisan hostility in our society. I hope to bring bipartisanship back to Congress because we need leaders that are willing to reach across the aisle and work together to solve the problems we all face.","priority1":"The reason why we can't do anything about gun violence, immigration, or healthcare reform is because our politics has gotten too nasty, hostile, and divisive. Everything now depends on what political party you are from. To fix the issues we face, we need to have elected officials that are willing to put aside partisan hostility and work with people they disagree with. When I go to Congress, I will sit down with Republicans and Democrats alike and make Congress work for all Americans. We have to have representatives that have the courage to stand for their convictions, be willing to face their constituents, and have the temperament and decency to do the hard work of governing.","priority2":"We have to have campaign finance reform. It goes against the nature of democracy that politicians are incentivized to curry favor with special interests over their own constituents. I promise to support legislation that would take money out of politics, that would restrict the influence of lobbyists on our political institutions, and that would undo the overwhelming influence that corporations and the super-wealthy have on our government. Americans deserve a Congress that represents them, not special interests. That's why I have pledged to turn down all corporate PAC money.","priority3":"We need substantive healthcare reform. The ACA was a great starting point, but we need politicians who want to fix and improve healthcare instead of burning it to the ground. We need to protect people from being denied coverage due to preexisting conditions, we need to lower insurance premiums by expanding Medicare and Medicaid and providing a government option to increase competition and options for the average family. We also need to listen to doctors, nurses, and other frontline healthcare professionals, and ensure that they are a part of the process instead of taking cues from only the insurance companies. When I was in college, my father got cancer. The cost of his treatment nearly bankrupted my family. I want to make sure that no American has to go through what mine did, because it is unacceptable that in the wealthiest nation in the world the number one cause of bankruptcy is healthcare costs. We are the only industrialized nation that faces this problem, and the way we fix that is by supporting universal healthcare.","contact":"Email: info@kulkarniforcongress.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":"Yes"},{"office":"U.S. House, District 22","name":"Kellen Sweny","party":"(I)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/07/63/16284908/4/rawImage.jpg","age":30,"hometown":"Pearland, Texas","birthplace":"Houston, Texas","job":"Manager","education":"Bachelor's Degree","education2":"","college":"Texas Tech University, 2009","married":"Married","kids":3,"prevServed":"No","prevOffice":"","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"","reason":"We need representatives who will put aside party politics and work together to find the best options to move us all forward. Washington is at a standstill because no one is willing to work together. We see consistent and convenient blame but not a hint of cooperation, servant leadership or true concern for the community. We need Congress to look like our nation, represent our nation, and move past sound bites, headlines and grandstanding that only serve to get them re-elected. I chose to run and help transform the current, broken status quo by constructing the government each one of us deserves: a government owned by the people, working for the people.","difference":"As an Independent, I am not beholden to anyone but my community. If we vote the way we always have, we will see the same outcomes we always have. Independent is not 'lukewarm'. Just the opposite: Independent is doing the hard work of bringing together differing opinions and turning them into lasting policy. A Congressperson should represent their constituents, not a party or special interests. I am free to listen to this community which historically votes 60% Republican, 40% Democratic. In a such balanced district, it's unfortunate that our current representative votes 96% of the time with his party, rather than our district.","priority1":"Balanced Budget: We cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road: our national debt and annual budget deficits are setting the country up for failure. What is most apparent is that the solution is easy to understand--increase revenue and decrease spending--but the practical implications are nearly impossible to navigate because it will involve sacrifice by everyone and politicians are unwilling to broach the conversation for fear of losing their jobs. The budget affects all aspects of governing, therefore solutions require more than soundbites and headlines to be appropriately thoughtful and not flippant. Resolving the budget will be a long process and require in depth review, many options, different perspectives, working and reworking until a comprehensive plan can be produced. Once in office I will govern with the understanding that each piece of legislation that could impact the financial wellbeing of our nation needs careful consideration and planning to avoid furthering the downward spiral but rather it should actively contribute to a sustainable financial future.","priority2":"Education Reform: Globally, the U.S. ranks 38th in math and 24th in science, yet spends the most per student. We must eliminate standardized tests in their current form, bring creativity back to classrooms, and allow teachers the freedom to address their students' individual needs. We must strike the right balance of local leadership and determination with common nationwide goals. We need to ensure consistent standards are being met but overhaul standardized testing practices. We must improve access to and support of pre-primary education programs, recognizing the significance and sensitivity of this foundational time in the education cycle. We must better prepare students during their time of transition to post-secondary education, focusing on the increased need for a balance of four-year programs, 2-year programs, certificate programs and job training programs and not a one-size-fits-all approach. We need to resolve the disparity caused by funding discrepancies due to the majority of available funds being determined by local property taxes. Most importantly, the details of any projected policy initiatives should be determined not by solely by politicians but rather in conjunction with the subject matter experts: a diverse group of teachers, administrators and parents whom know best how to succeed through meaningful, lasting reform. Many times, when complex issues and multiple jurisdictions overlap, politicians can't point their fingers fast enough at the other parties to pass the blame on anything negative but still take all the credit for the positive. Education is no different: it is widely understood that something needs to change as it is clear we are not meeting the expectations we have set for ourselves as a nation, but local, state and federal bureaucracies have yet to work together. No one has yet stepped up to take ownership of their contribution nor lead any of their fellow contributors successfully. As a Congresswoman, my office will be about coalitions, uniting all the various levels of government and holding myself, my colleagues, and my state and local partners accountable to following through.","priority3":"Universal Healthcare Access: There is general recognition across the ideological spectrum that providing for healthy individuals and families is not only financially and socially valuable for our communities, but also morally imperative. While a lasting solution has yet to be implemented, the pursuit of ensuring each citizen has access to affordable healthcare must remain a top priority. Healthcare must meet the unique needs of millions of people. Expecting that one answer can solve all of the healthcare issues is like expecting everyone to fit into the same size pants. Healthcare must address pre-existing conditions and be accessible by individuals, small business and large corporations alike. There should be a safety net to catch the least among us and it should never be a question of potentially choosing between your life and affording the care you need. There must be a balance between healthcare company profits and consumer protection from exorbitant prices. Once elected, I will unite all of these complex concerns to strike the right mix of options, protections and freedoms.","contact":"Phone: 281-643-7103; Facebook: facebook.com/KellenForCongress; Instagram: instagram.com/KellenForCongress; Twitter: @KellenTX22; Website: KellenForCongress.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"U.S. House, District 22","name":"John B.

Ensuring we stay healthy means knowing that our residents are rightly concerned about access to and affordability of health care. Congress is not helping. We stay healthy by reversing the impact of reckless partisanship and working with both parties to bring down the cost of health care by introducing common-sense, cost-saving measures like allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices; to defend women’s access to reproductive health care; and to fight any attempt to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes, or asthma.","priority2":"Making our city more resilient by bolstering infrastructure to keep us safe from increasing and more frequent weather events, and partnering with our local agencies to make smart investments in transit. It means encouraging federal revitalization programs that provide communities like ours the resources we need to be prepared for, and reduce the costs of, the next storm, passing a federal infrastructure investment plan that puts money into infrastructure improvements while creating local jobs, and working with METRO to expand our transit system to keep our workforce–and our economy–moving forward.","priority3":"Keeping us safe, which means making smart policy and enforcing it by working with and across our diverse community. It means strengthening our border security by making smart investments in Border Patrol and new technologies; by reforming our immigration laws to protect Dreamers and those who follow the law and contribute to our economy; by reducing gun violence; by making sure law enforcement, including ICE, can do its job to keep our communities safe; and by ensuring our justice system is efficient and fair.

As a community, we have focused not on where people are from, but on what they can become, what strengths they bring to our community and how we can work together to make a better Houston. Our country is no different. Just as Houstonians have embraced immigrants, we as a nation must do the same. Congress must pass legislation that addresses the status of DREAMers; provide a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows, and reform our current system to provide balanced family reunification policies as well as continue providing visas that attract talent to our country. There must also be fair and just options for people seeking refuge from violence or persecution. Families should be kept together when seeking refuge at our border. The asylum definition should clarify 'persecution' and 'particular social group' to reflect current immigration challenges in Central America. Immigration courts should be moved and operate under the federal judicial branch to provide independence from political influence.","priority2":"Criminal Justice Reform. Our system needs help. If we ever get a chance to talk, ask me about that time in 2014 I got arrested and spent a night at the city jail. That experience showed me firsthand how our current system disproportionately affects black and latino men. We need to comprehensively address the use of force in police departments, and promote more fair and just interactions with vulnerable and communities of color; invest in the infrastructure for community policing as a measure of prevention; implement policies that decrease mass incarceration; encourage and incentivize evidence-based community reentry programs; and reform our current cash bail system to ensure equal justice that isn't based on a defendant's ability to pay.","priority3":"Healthcare. Good health should be a part of all of our lives. Houston is home to the largest medical complex in the world, but both our state and country have little to show for it in terms of health outcomes. I won't bore you with statistics, but just know that the United States spends the most money in the world on healthcare per person, but we don't have anywhere near the best health outcomes. Good health starts with people having equal opportunity access to good healthcare regardless of how much money they make. The Affordable Care Act was a good start and the next step is Medicare For All, a single payer system that will cover people in our country and over the long run bring down the cost of healthcare. Health is a human right and in this country we've gone far too long without treating it as such.","contact":"Phone: 713-855-4789; Email: benjamin@peoplecampaign.org; Facebook: www.facebook.com/benjaminforcongress; Instagram: www.instagram.com/benjaminforcongress; Twitter: www.twitter.com/benjaminTX09; Website: www.benjaminforcongress.com","unopposed":"","endorsed":""},{"office":"U.S. House, District 9","name":"Phil Kurtz","party":"(L)","image":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/03/12/16265880/5/rawImage.jpg","age":61,"hometown":"Katy, Texas","birthplace":"Detroit, Michigan","job":"Semi Retired Business Consultant","education":"Master's Degree","education2":"Master's in Engineering, Master's in Business Administration","college":"University of Houston- 2009\nBauer Business School- 2009","married":"Married","kids":2,"prevServed":"No","prevOffice":"","military":"No","milBranch":"","incumbent":"","partyColor":"#ECC850","reason":"To provide the citizens of District 9 with an Conservative Alternative","difference":"I'm Pro Life, Pro Liberty, Pro 2A, Pro Immigration Reform, Pro Border Security, Pro Tax Reform.

We are running to represent all 28 million Texans and ensure they are listened to, fought for, served, and represented in the Senate.","difference":"We are not running this campaign against anything, anyone, or any party. We are running for Texas and the United States of America. We are running so that our state can take the lead in getting after the big, bold, aspirational work of this country -- so that Texas can be a bridge over the smallness, the pettiness, the fear that dominates so much of our politics. That’s why I want to be a Senator who fights for the issues that matter to Texans -- healthcare, education, immigration reform, good paying jobs, veterans care, making our justice system more fair by enacting true criminal justice reform, investing in infrastructure, and taking on climate change. I also want to ensure every single Texan is represented in the Senate by a full-time, full-service Senator. I listen to my constituents rather than PACs or corporations, and I’ve spent the last six years holding monthly town hall meetings back home in El Paso where I am held accountable by those who put me in this position of public trust. Texas also needs a Senator who is willing to work with anyone, anywhere, anytime to get the work of this country done. We’ve got to get past the divisiveness of party and get on with the business of our nation. That’s how I was able to improve access to mental healthcare for those who served our country and it’s how I want to work as a Senator. Remembering that before we are Republicans or Democrats, we are Texans, we are Americans, we are human beings. If there were ever a time to demonstrate that, it is now.","priority1":"Making sure every single Texas can live to their full potential. That means they are able to see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, and get the care they need -- not as a function of luck or circumstance, but as a basic right. We do that by lowering prescription drug costs, protecting Medicare from cuts, expanding Medicaid, defending protections for those with pre-existing conditions, and achieving guaranteed, universal health care for every man, woman, and child. It also means ensuring an economy that works for everyone so we invest in all communities and all people. So everyone has access to good jobs that pay a living wage and loans to start small businesses. We should also support working families by expanding paid family and sick leave, affordable child care, pre-K, and homeownership. And it means reforming our justice system to be more fair -- ending the school-to-prison pipeline and the federal prohibition on marijuana.","priority2":"I want Texas -- the most diverse state in the country and the defining border state -- to lead the way in rewriting our immigration laws to reflect our values and our interests. Recognizing we are a nation of laws -- one that can maintain order at the border without dehumanizing anyone -- we have to put a stop to family separation, ensure that every separated family is reunified, pass the DREAM Act, provide immigrants with a fair path to work and citizenship, and ensure that everyone who comes to this country can contribute to their full potential.","priority3":"Every single child deserves access to a high-quality education. We must keep public school dollars in public school classrooms, ensure equity in funding, and empower teachers to teach to students -- not to high-stakes, high-pressure standardized tests. Let’s make sure higher education is affordable too, whether it be at a university or trade school, a community college or apprenticeship.
